# ND-Interval Doing arithmetic on n dimensional intervals 

With ND-Interval, you can ....

# Overview
The NDArray Python package was written with fast use in mind. It provides the following key features

  - construct nd-intervals .
  - do operations on nd-intervals like AND and OR to construct complex intervals
  - batch operations on nd-intervals for scaling operations on intervals 


## Usage

In the following paragraphs, I am going to describe how you can get and use Ndarray for your own projects.

###  Getting it

To download ndinterval, either fork this github repo or simply use Pypi via pip.
```sh
$ pip install ndinterval
```

### Using it

ndinterval was programmed with ease-of-use in mind. First, import the package

```Python
import ndinterval as ndinterval
```

And you are ready to go! At this point, 

## Examples:
Here is a list of examples of operations that you can do with nd-intervals 

### 1.Construct ND-intervals 


```Python
print("HI")
```

### 2.Union of nd intervals 

```Python
print("HI")
```

### 3.Union of nd intervals 

```Python
print("HI")
```
